# Introduction
Thank you for coming to my everything snowflake documentation. Please use or share any of the available material. Each page has a video to go with the tutorial for those visual learners. These tutorials are not Snowflake official; please use [https://docs.snowflake.com/](https://docs.snowflake.com/).

## If you find the tutorials useful
Thats great to hear! If you want to help the author in promoting them, simply like the videos on youtube or consider send an appreciation email to [daniel.wilczk@snowflake.com](#) and/or my manager [ben.earley@snowflake.com](#). It can never hurt with promotions right around the corner.
