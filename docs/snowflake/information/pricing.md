# Versions of Snowflake:
Each version of snowflake  on two primary costs. **Compute** and **storage**.

### Credit system:
Compute (Doing processing work on snowflake) uses a "credit" system. A credit is a representation of a dollar figure that depends on what snowflake version you are using ([$2 - Standard](#), [$3 - Enterprise](#), and [$4 busniess critical](#)). 

## Compute ($2,$3, or $4 per credit)(1 credit = XS warehouse for 1 hour)
Size always matters and snowflake is no different. We use T-Shirt sizes, XS, S, M, L, XL, etc. To put it into perspective, you can run an XS for 1 hours and if you use stanrd snowflake. It will cost you $2 for that hour.

## Storage ($40 or $23 per tb / per month)
Storage is ~$40 per terabyte / per month. On a [capacity agreement (Prepaided)](#) this will go down to ~$23. For an exact number please for your location, please use the snowflake calulator.
